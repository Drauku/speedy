## Features

- Test the download & upload speed of your internet connection
- Save the results for historic analysis
- Ready to use dashboard to review the results

## Requirements

- Docker (e.g. Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows)

## Installation

Fork the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/stefanwalther/speedy
```

Then run from the root directory:
```sh
$ docker-compose -d up
```

This will essentially spin up three containers:

- **speedy** - Tiny node.js service to run a speed-test periodically (based on [speedtest-net](https://github.com/ddsol/speedtest.net).
- **InfluxDB** - Time series database to store the results from speedy, based on [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb).
- **Grafana** - Pre-Configured [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) instance to visualize the results.

### Configuration



## Developing

Run the development environment:

```sh
$ yarn dc-dev-up
```

The development differs as follows from the example above:

- Containers are build on demand (from the Dockerfiles)
- You can work on the source code in `./docker/speedy/src` and the solution will automatically get updated (using nodemon).
